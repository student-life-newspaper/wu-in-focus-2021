                                    <p class="dear-readers">Dear readers,</p>
                                    <p>WU in Focus was established in the fall of 2018 as a dedicated space to understand how all of the people of Washington University make the community we know. We launched the second installment in the late spring of 2020, as students were faced with another challenge: the COVID-19 global pandemic. It’ll just be through the end of the semester, end of the summer, end of the calendar year, we told ourselves as we faced challenges we could have never anticipated.</p>                            
                                    <p>In the midst of this uncertainty, global anti-racist movements like Black Lives Matter and groups fighting anti-Asian hatred defined campus as the structural racism, discrimination and inequities that plague the University came under increased scrutiny as students demanded justice and change. The work of activists spurred movements calling for the abolition of Greek life and of the Washington University Police Department. Students fought against anti-Asian racism and collectively demanded that the University community reckon with the inequities generations of students, faculty and community members have had to face.</p>
                                    <p>As a student newspaper, we have a unique position on campus. Our reporters and writers often get a bird’s-eye view of the University community. Across our five sections, we have an opportunity to speak with and learn from the different voices that shape the University into what it is. It is spaces like WU in Focus, however, that give us a chance to dive in headfirst. </p>
                                    <p>In this issue, you’ll find reporting on how activist movements like the abolish WUPD took hold on campus, the ways students have experienced the COVID-19 pandemic, how students are fighting against anti-Asian racism and so much more. The reporting in this magazine is a product of the voices of this campus. We hope that this special issue challenges you to think about how the intersecting identities of students, advocacy work on campus and the history of our University shape how your time here is spent. </p>
                                    <p>This issue is shaped by you, as part of our University community. I want to thank you for your readership, engagement and for helping to make this University community what it is: a vibrant, dynamic, diverse and curious place. </p>
                                    <p>All that being said, it is my absolute pleasure to present Student Life’s third installment of WU in Focus.</p>
                                    <p>Take care,</p>

                                        <p class="caption">The Association of Black Collegians leads a sit in at the office of Campus Police, protesting the assault and arrest of Elbert Walton in 1968.</p>
                                    </div>
                                    <p class="dropcap-light-blue">More than 50 years after one of the first protests in response to injustice from Washington University in St. Louis law enforcement, the increased visibility of police brutality has led to a proliferation of groups challenging the role of policing at the University.</p>
                                    <p>In 1968, prior to the formation of WUPD, Elbert Walton, a Black graduate student, was arrested and assaulted by campus police. The event sparked a 30-person sit-in at the office of the campus police followed by an eight-day occupation of Brookings Hall, according to reporting from Student Life.</p>
                                    <p>Led by the Association of Black Collegians (ABC), a Black student activist group, students demanded the suspension of the police officer involved and outlined &ldquo;5 points for developing a position paper on law enforcement reform.&rdquo; These points included better screening and selection of officers, increased officer salaries, improved training, stronger sense of community between law enforcement and students and altered police focus.</p>
                                    <p>During the sit-in, ABC published the Black Position Paper where they saw the mistreatment of Black students by police as a symptom of a lack of University commitment to its Black students and faculty.</p>
                                    <p>&ldquo;The matter of the campus police department&rsquo;s maltreatment of and demeaning attitudes toward Black people does not present the total scope of the problem. It simply reflects and points out the unresponsive, insensitive and negative nature of Washington University vis-a-vis the Black people who come into direct and/or indirect contact with it,&rdquo; the group wrote.</p>
                                    <p>The then Chancellor Thomas H. Eliot responded to the student&rsquo;s demands with &ldquo;reluctant acceptance,&rdquo; according to Robert Johnson, a leader of the ABC.</p>
                                    <p>&ldquo;An eight-member joint committee, chaired by Mr. Andrew Thomas, is making the investigation of selection processes, training, etc. that was recommended by the panel which heard allegations of a pattern of harassment of Black students,&rdquo; Eliot wrote in a March 1969 letter to the University faculty, administration officers and staff.</p>
                                    <p>Over 50 years after the sit-in, the nature of the University&rsquo;s police force has dramatically changed.</p>
                                    <p>WUPD &ldquo;was first established in 1969 as a kind of security department,&rdquo; Executive Vice Chancellor for Civic Affairs and Strategic Planning Hank Webber explained. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s now about 57/58 employees, 37 officers&#8230;In the mid-&rsquo;70s, they became deputized so that they had police powers on campus.&rdquo;</p>
                                    <p>In the 2000s, WUPD transitioned to a community policing model, gaining a &ldquo;major presence in the neighborhood,&rdquo; Webber added.</p>
                                    <p>Still, students continued to object to this expansion of WUPD&rsquo;s presence on campus. On January 23, 2015, in reaction to police brutality across the country, especially the shooting of Michael Brown which occurred just a few miles away from campus, the student group Students in Solidarity (SIS) published a new list of demands, some of which addressed WUPD.</p>
                                    <p>&ldquo;Today, we are sparked by the unconscionable killings of Michael Brown, Eric Garner, John Crawford, Aiyana Jones, Tamir Rice, Yvette Smith, Kajieme Powell, and hundreds more,&rdquo; SIS wrote in their manifesto.</p>
                                    <p>Their demands included but were not limited to mental health support and bias training for WUPD officers, a third-party review of current training procedures, phone and web applications to report WUPD bias and publication of reports of WUPD bias.</p>
                                    <p>According to WUPD Chief Mark Glenn, WUPD officers receive mental health and anti-bias training. He reported that there have been recent audits of these procedures. Additionally, instances of WUPD bias can be reported through the University&rsquo;s bias reporting system.</p>
                                    <p>Although the service does not offer a phone line for reporting, general summaries of bias reports that provide targeted identities and locations reported are available through the University website. The most recent report was posted in 2018.</p>
                                    <p>Professor Gerald Early, a member of the public safety committee focused on examining WUPD&rsquo;s role on campus, attributed the recent rise of student activism directed at University police in part to increased visibility of police brutality.</p>
                                    <p>&ldquo;I think that&rsquo;s made a particular kind of impact to see some of this stuff actually being filmed,&rdquo; Early said.</p>
                                    <p>A student group formed at the beginning of last semester, WashU Students for Abolition, is one of the first to have the primary aim of fully abolishing WUPD. The organization fights to decrease WUPD presence, move WUPD funding to campus resources such as the Sexual Assault and Rape Anonymous Helpline (S.A.R.A.H) and the Rape and Sexual Violence Prevention (R.S.V.P) Center, hire more mental health counselors and, ultimately, abolish WUPD, student organizer junior Jasmine MacFarlane said.</p>
                                    <p>&ldquo;Reform usually comes with more money, more training, more officers, and it makes the system larger rather than addressing the root issues. Abolition addresses the root issues that create crime,&rdquo; MacFarlane stated.</p>
                                    <p>Glenn emphasized that a lack of meaningful change to police departments can drive people towards abolition.</p>
                                    <p>&ldquo;If we're not getting change and we're still seeing that [police brutality], we as a society then are going to continue pushing forward, and if that means you know that we're going to call to abolish police departments, you know, that's where people are going to go if they don't see change,&rdquo; Glenn said.</p>
                                    <p>According to Glenn, WUPD is committed to reform.</p>
                                    <p>&ldquo;We want to make sure that we're providing the best possible service to our community, and, to do that, you really have to listen to the community and be willing to change,&rdquo; Glenn said.</p>
                                    <p>Webber noted WUPD&rsquo;s 2018 accreditation through the Commission of Accreditation for Law Enforcement Agencies (CALEA).</p>
                                    <p>&ldquo;One of the reasons that we went through the international accreditation process, for example, was to make sure that an outside review was making sure that we were meeting the highest law enforcement standards for a university police department,&rdquo; Webber said.</p>
                                    <p>MacFarlane sees campus police presence as directly linked to increased &ldquo;student consciousness and activism.&rdquo;</p>
                                    <p>Campus police &ldquo;sprung up directly in the &lsquo;60s and &lsquo;70s in response to civil rights movements on campus, in response to anti-war protests on campus,&rdquo; MacFarlane said. &ldquo;So, police presence usually is less about students&rsquo; security and more about quelling unrest.&rdquo;</p>
                                    <p>The SIS concluded the foreword of their manifesto with a call to action.</p>
                                    <p>&ldquo;The University must live up to its mission statement &lsquo;to strive to enhance the lives and livelihoods of students, the people of the greater St. Louis community, the country, and the world,&rsquo;&rdquo; they wrote. &ldquo;Seize this crucial moment in history to affirm that Black Lives Matter.&rdquo; </p>
