                                    <p class="dear-readers">Dear readers,</p>
                                    <p>WU in Focus was established in the fall of 2018 as a dedicated space to understand how all of the people of Washington University make the community we know. We launched the second installment in the late spring of 2020, as students were faced with another challenge: the COVID-19 global pandemic. It’ll just be through the end of the semester, end of the summer, end of the calendar year, we told ourselves as we faced challenges we could have never anticipated.</p>                            
                                    <p>In the midst of this uncertainty, global anti-racist movements like Black Lives Matter and groups fighting anti-Asian hatred defined campus as the structural racism, discrimination and inequities that plague the University came under increased scrutiny as students demanded justice and change. The work of activists spurred movements calling for the abolition of Greek life and of the Washington University Police Department. Students fought against anti-Asian racism and collectively demanded that the University community reckon with the inequities generations of students, faculty and community members have had to face.</p>
                                    <p>As a student newspaper, we have a unique position on campus. Our reporters and writers often get a bird’s-eye view of the University community. Across our five sections, we have an opportunity to speak with and learn from the different voices that shape the University into what it is. It is spaces like WU in Focus, however, that give us a chance to dive in headfirst. </p>
                                    <p>In this issue, you’ll find reporting on how activist movements like the abolish WUPD took hold on campus, the ways students have experienced the COVID-19 pandemic, how students are fighting against anti-Asian racism and so much more. The reporting in this magazine is a product of the voices of this campus. We hope that this special issue challenges you to think about how the intersecting identities of students, advocacy work on campus and the history of our University shape how your time here is spent. </p>
                                    <p>This issue is shaped by you, as part of our University community. I want to thank you for your readership, engagement and for helping to make this University community what it is: a vibrant, dynamic, diverse and curious place. </p>
                                    <p>All that being said, it is my absolute pleasure to present Student Life’s third installment of WU in Focus.</p>
                                    <p>Take care,</p>

                                        <p class="caption">The Association of Black Collegians leads a sit in at the office of Campus Police, protesting the assault and arrest of Elbert Walton in 1968.</p>
                                    </div>
                                    <p class="dropcap-light-blue">More than 50 years after one of the first protests in response to injustice from Washington University in St. Louis law enforcement, the increased visibility of police brutality has led to a proliferation of groups challenging the role of policing at the University.</p>
                                    <p>In 1968, prior to the formation of WUPD, Elbert Walton, a Black graduate student, was arrested and assaulted by campus police. The event sparked a 30-person sit-in at the office of the campus police followed by an eight-day occupation of Brookings Hall, according to reporting from Student Life.</p>
                                    <p>Led by the Association of Black Collegians (ABC), a Black student activist group, students demanded the suspension of the police officer involved and outlined &ldquo;5 points for developing a position paper on law enforcement reform.&rdquo; These points included better screening and selection of officers, increased officer salaries, improved training, stronger sense of community between law enforcement and students and altered police focus.</p>
                                    <p>During the sit-in, ABC published the Black Position Paper where they saw the mistreatment of Black students by police as a symptom of a lack of University commitment to its Black students and faculty.</p>
                                    <p>&ldquo;The matter of the campus police department&rsquo;s maltreatment of and demeaning attitudes toward Black people does not present the total scope of the problem. It simply reflects and points out the unresponsive, insensitive and negative nature of Washington University vis-a-vis the Black people who come into direct and/or indirect contact with it,&rdquo; the group wrote.</p>
                                    <p>The then Chancellor Thomas H. Eliot responded to the student&rsquo;s demands with &ldquo;reluctant acceptance,&rdquo; according to Robert Johnson, a leader of the ABC.</p>
                                    <p>&ldquo;An eight-member joint committee, chaired by Mr. Andrew Thomas, is making the investigation of selection processes, training, etc. that was recommended by the panel which heard allegations of a pattern of harassment of Black students,&rdquo; Eliot wrote in a March 1969 letter to the University faculty, administration officers and staff.</p>
                                    <p>Over 50 years after the sit-in, the nature of the University&rsquo;s police force has dramatically changed.</p>
                                    <p>WUPD &ldquo;was first established in 1969 as a kind of security department,&rdquo; Executive Vice Chancellor for Civic Affairs and Strategic Planning Hank Webber explained. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s now about 57/58 employees, 37 officers&#8230;In the mid-&rsquo;70s, they became deputized so that they had police powers on campus.&rdquo;</p>
                                    <p>In the 2000s, WUPD transitioned to a community policing model, gaining a &ldquo;major presence in the neighborhood,&rdquo; Webber added.</p>
                                    <p>Still, students continued to object to this expansion of WUPD&rsquo;s presence on campus. On January 23, 2015, in reaction to police brutality across the country, especially the shooting of Michael Brown which occurred just a few miles away from campus, the student group Students in Solidarity (SIS) published a new list of demands, some of which addressed WUPD.</p>
                                    <p>&ldquo;Today, we are sparked by the unconscionable killings of Michael Brown, Eric Garner, John Crawford, Aiyana Jones, Tamir Rice, Yvette Smith, Kajieme Powell, and hundreds more,&rdquo; SIS wrote in their manifesto.</p>
                                    <p>Their demands included but were not limited to mental health support and bias training for WUPD officers, a third-party review of current training procedures, phone and web applications to report WUPD bias and publication of reports of WUPD bias.</p>
                                    <p>According to WUPD Chief Mark Glenn, WUPD officers receive mental health and anti-bias training. He reported that there have been recent audits of these procedures. Additionally, instances of WUPD bias can be reported through the University&rsquo;s bias reporting system.</p>
                                    <p>Although the service does not offer a phone line for reporting, general summaries of bias reports that provide targeted identities and locations reported are available through the University website. The most recent report was posted in 2018.</p>
                                    <p>Professor Gerald Early, a member of the public safety committee focused on examining WUPD&rsquo;s role on campus, attributed the recent rise of student activism directed at University police in part to increased visibility of police brutality.</p>
                                    <p>&ldquo;I think that&rsquo;s made a particular kind of impact to see some of this stuff actually being filmed,&rdquo; Early said.</p>
                                    <p>A student group formed at the beginning of last semester, WashU Students for Abolition, is one of the first to have the primary aim of fully abolishing WUPD. The organization fights to decrease WUPD presence, move WUPD funding to campus resources such as the Sexual Assault and Rape Anonymous Helpline (S.A.R.A.H) and the Rape and Sexual Violence Prevention (R.S.V.P) Center, hire more mental health counselors and, ultimately, abolish WUPD, student organizer junior Jasmine MacFarlane said.</p>
                                    <p>&ldquo;Reform usually comes with more money, more training, more officers, and it makes the system larger rather than addressing the root issues. Abolition addresses the root issues that create crime,&rdquo; MacFarlane stated.</p>
                                    <p>Glenn emphasized that a lack of meaningful change to police departments can drive people towards abolition.</p>
                                    <p>&ldquo;If we're not getting change and we're still seeing that [police brutality], we as a society then are going to continue pushing forward, and if that means you know that we're going to call to abolish police departments, you know, that's where people are going to go if they don't see change,&rdquo; Glenn said.</p>
                                    <p>According to Glenn, WUPD is committed to reform.</p>
                                    <p>&ldquo;We want to make sure that we're providing the best possible service to our community, and, to do that, you really have to listen to the community and be willing to change,&rdquo; Glenn said.</p>
                                    <p>Webber noted WUPD&rsquo;s 2018 accreditation through the Commission of Accreditation for Law Enforcement Agencies (CALEA).</p>
                                    <p>&ldquo;One of the reasons that we went through the international accreditation process, for example, was to make sure that an outside review was making sure that we were meeting the highest law enforcement standards for a university police department,&rdquo; Webber said.</p>
                                    <p>MacFarlane sees campus police presence as directly linked to increased &ldquo;student consciousness and activism.&rdquo;</p>
                                    <p>Campus police &ldquo;sprung up directly in the &lsquo;60s and &lsquo;70s in response to civil rights movements on campus, in response to anti-war protests on campus,&rdquo; MacFarlane said. &ldquo;So, police presence usually is less about students&rsquo; security and more about quelling unrest.&rdquo;</p>
                                    <p>The SIS concluded the foreword of their manifesto with a call to action.</p>
                                    <p>&ldquo;The University must live up to its mission statement &lsquo;to strive to enhance the lives and livelihoods of students, the people of the greater St. Louis community, the country, and the world,&rsquo;&rdquo; they wrote. &ldquo;Seize this crucial moment in history to affirm that Black Lives Matter.&rdquo; </p>

                                <p class="dropcap-light-blue">My first week at Washington University was exciting and terrifying in all the ways first weeks usually are. For me, beyond the customary first-week stilted conversations and first walks to the Delmar Loop, I remember feeling nervous for another reason: Sunday.</p>

                                <p>Before I came to Wash. U., Sundays were church days, and functioned differently than the rest of the days of the week. On Sundays, I set my alarms and woke up early. I sang hymns, read scripture and asked for prayers. Sunday was the day of the week on which I wore the mask, professing what I didn&rsquo;t believe to blend in with the crowd.</p>
                                
                                <p>I knew since I was 12 that I was unconvinced of the existence of a God, but the process of coming to terms with that fact was infinitely less certain. Every woman in my family was deeply religious. God wasn&rsquo;t a question but a foregone conclusion, and it felt scary&mdash;alienating, really&mdash;to challenge it. Moreover, growing up in a majority-white area and school, churches were some of the first and only primarily Black spaces I had ever encountered. Blackness and spirituality went hand in hand, and it was a connection steeped in history I was proud to be a part of. In church, I knew that the hymns I sang used to be slave spirituals&mdash;that the prayers I learned were popularized by Black church leaders. I felt a little closer to my loved ones, my ancestors.</p>
                                
                                <p>However, by my senior year of high school, the cultural aspect of religion no longer felt like enough. I wanted to confront the things I believed and the reasons why I believed them. I hated feeling like I had inherited a worldview rather than chosen one. So, months before I left for Wash. U., I tried to evaluate the contents of my brain. What things do I believe? What things am I unconvinced of? What things do I never want to believe again? When I finally arrived at the term &ldquo;atheist,&rdquo; it felt like a fundamental rejection not only of my belief system but of part of my culture. Church started to feel empty; the hymns and prayers no longer felt like they belonged to me. Religion had been such a formative and intrinsic part of many of my family members&rsquo; lives&mdash;something to cling to through difficult times, a source of spiritual peace and in some cases a reason to stay alive. But suddenly, it was an experience that we could no longer pretend to share. I felt like I was excising myself from both my family and my culture. Frightening as that was, I knew that being hundreds of miles away from home at Wash. U. would be my real chance.</p>
                                
                                <p>My first Sunday at Wash. U., I slept in. I tidied my dorm and tried Village Brunch for the first time. My Sundays belonged to me&mdash;only me. Not only my Sundays, but all of my days. I stopped praying before my meals and stopped asking for forgiveness when I used God&rsquo;s name in vain. And I was terrified.</p>
                                
                                <p>I knew very few Black atheists. I definitely didn&rsquo;t know any other Black female atheists. As far as my family was concerned, I was still a practicing Christian. I couldn&rsquo;t find any secular or atheist organizations on campus&mdash;at least, none that were still active. So I began the process of deconverting myself on my own. And just as much as I knew I didn&rsquo;t necessarily belong in the atheist community, the community knew that I didn&rsquo;t belong, either. The atheist spaces I perused were almost always exclusionary. I rented books from atheist thinkers whom I later realized believed that I had an &ldquo;unconscious wish for brutal male domination&rdquo; and spewed vile, Islamophobic sentiments at every opportunity. I participated in forums that deferred to male pronouns as a rule and witnessed a concerning pipeline from secularism to alt-right beliefs. I went from being welcomed as a Black Christian in a large community to being invisible and often unwelcome as a Black atheist in a tiny community.</p>
                                
                                <p>There is a certain image that comes to mind when one pictures the manifestation of the word &ldquo;atheist.&rdquo; That image is white and male, and not without reason&mdash;data from Pew Research&rsquo;s 2014 Religious Landscape Survey found that 78% of all atheists identified as white, and 68% identified as male. On the other hand, a 2020 Pew survey found that 97% of Black adults believed in a higher power. Only one percent identified with the term &ldquo;atheist.&rdquo; Over one-third of all Black adults in the United States attended services at a church that was majority Black. Black women were more likely than Black men to say that religion was very important in their lives&mdash;64% compared to 51%.</p>
                                
                                <p>The lack of a belief in a higher power tends to be higher among college students and graduates, so the demographic breakdown within colleges could likely look different than the data nationwide. However, the culture around belief in many Black spaces does not encourage the open expression of nonreligious beliefs even when we arrive at college. A few months into my freshman year, a Black female friend of mine, in whom I had confided my religious doubts while we were in high school, reached out to me and admitted that she was also in the process of deconverting herself. I called her and we talked for hours&mdash;about lying to our families about attending church services regularly while away at school; about following religious rituals when at home to avoid an argument; about feeling lonely and unaccepted by atheist spaces that we attempted to join; about the frustration of our families' attempts to proselytize us, or their assumptions that we were immoral. It was unbelievably cathartic to express those emotions to someone who could understand the full depth of the intersection of experiences within Black female atheism&mdash;a minority within the minority.</p>
                                
                                <p>My family and denomination raised me to sincerely believe in divine, eternal retribution. It is not easy to stop believing in that&mdash;it is not easy to assure yourself that you will not be tortured for not being able to believe the things everyone else believes. It is not easy knowing that some of your dearest loved ones truly believe that you deserve that fate. It is not easy to carry these things while being an outsider on multiple fronts. Not easy, but not impossible. I&rsquo;m learning to enjoy brunch on Sunday mornings.</p>

                                <p class="dropcap-light-blue">Katie Lawson, a freshman on the Washington University volleyball team, still has practice in the mornings. Her phone buzzes early, but sometimes it takes multiple times hitting the snooze button to roll out of bed. Lawson has never been a morning person. That is where her suitemate, who is also on the volleyball team, comes in. They will knock on each other&rsquo;s door if they accidentally sleep in. And ultimately, what motivates her during those early morning practices is the thought of her teammates, who are also excited to be there. In that respect, it could be any other year.</p>

                                <p>So many elements of freshmen athletes&rsquo; first year at Washington University have been different because of the pandemic, like the threat of quarantine&mdash;and everyone coped differently. A cross country runner uploaded a five kilometer run onto Strava, a run-sharing platform, from the confines of his quarantine room. Student-athletes searched YouTube for the craziest workouts they could find that were doable within their confines. Freshman golfer Caraline Oakley even putted from her quarantine room in preparation for her tournament win in her debut outing for the University.</p>

                                <p>Across various Bears teams, student-athletes are comparing their hopes during signing to the reality of being on a University team. Lawson committed to Wash. U. volleyball because of the competitive nature of the program. Those expectations for a positive yet challenging environment have mostly been met, despite how things have looked different. &ldquo;I wish we could have more of that game day experience,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;But I still wouldn&rsquo;t trade anything in the world for the experience that I have and the opportunities I&rsquo;ve been able to receive.&rdquo;   For Lawson, like most others, playing at Wash. U. has been a transition from her less driven high school team. There, she found that some people played volleyball purely for the social aspect of the experience. They did not spend much time dedicating themselves to improvement. But at Wash. U., the entire team is much more competitive and hardworking, even in such an irregular season. That, she says, has been fun to be a part of. &ldquo;As someone who enjoys competing and likes to win,&rdquo; Lawson said, &quot;it reassures me that all these people have the same goals and aspirations. They&rsquo;ll have my back.&rdquo;</p>

                                <p>The lack of competition has been hard for everyone. In high school, volleyball athletes play constantly, so Lawson feels out of practice from what she calls game mode. The upside of that is that it has allowed her to spend more time working on technique and overall strength. When they do eventually play next, all NCAA teams will &ldquo;be starting from square one,&rdquo; in terms of competition experience, Lawson said. &ldquo;It will really show who put in the work, who was dedicated and disciplined. It&rsquo;ll be fun to see who progressed over the past year and who let things slide.&rdquo;</p>

                                <p>But not every team has been able to have that same experience of working together with a future goal in mind. One freshman track and field athlete, Ally Sarussi, had high aspirations that have been put on hold with the fluctuating competition season. As with many other athletes, it was the family atmosphere of the track team that first drew her to Wash. U. Although she has bonded with the teammates who are in her specific workout group, Sarussi has been isolated from the group at large. The team has had to split into pods for practice, a system that has prevented her from meeting most of her teammates. &ldquo;It makes it really hard,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s been different and not exactly favorable, but better to get to know some people than none, I guess.&rdquo;</p>

                                <p>Track specifically has had a few time trials, and Sarussi says that they have really helped her grasp the joy of competing again. Instead of stressing over small issues, she has learned to take advantage of the race day environment that she has. And while that is not necessarily glamorous, with fans filling the bleachers, she feels that it has rewarded the training she has put in. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the small wins of being able to compete even against our teammates,&rdquo; Sarussi said. Similarly to Sarussi, Micah Benson, a freshman on the cross country team, has made the most of the training that he has been able to put in. His time on the team has consisted of periods of smaller group practice separated by pauses and COVID-19 outbreaks. Those changes have rewarded him with time for a slower transition into college athletics. As he trains more with head coach Jeff Stiles, the difficulty of the workouts has been ramping up. One piece of advice that Benson&rsquo;s high school coach gave him was not to expect to be automatically better in college. So even though he might not be in the same shape as his senior year of high school, he is not worried.</p>

                                <p>Benson is also growing through Stiles&rsquo; holistic approach to training. A major difference that he has found between running at Wash. U. and his training in high school is how invested the coaching staff is. He said that Stiles cares about everyone on the team, no matter their place on the roster. &ldquo;He told us that he feels bad that he&rsquo;s not connecting enough&mdash;he&rsquo;s doing such a good job with it though,&rdquo; Benson said. &ldquo;So I&rsquo;m excited for when we&rsquo;re back to normal.&rdquo; That progress is not always linear, however, as Kenneth Yeh, a freshmen on the swim team, has realized this semester. As a distance swimmer, he has had to adjust his workouts and mentality to match the restrictions on time in the pool. Many times, the shortened pool slots just do not feel like enough time to get in a proper warm-up, workout and cooldown. &ldquo;That transition has been more difficult for me than others,&rdquo; Yeh said. The team is doing more sprint and power-oriented workouts, which have been hard both mentally and physically for him. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not thinking negatively, but it has made a change on me. And I think I just need more time to adjust to it,&rdquo; he said.</p>

                                <p>The day after the NCAA competitions and the conference championships were canceled for Yeh&rsquo;s first season for Wash. U., he headed to practice assuming that his coaches would make workouts a little easier. He was surprised then when the coaching staff did not let up. So when Yeh had the opportunity to compete during the two meets of the swim team&rsquo;s season, he had to make the most of his limited opportunities. And that, he says, has been tough, particularly with the change in training. It is especially hard with such a time-based sport like swim, where the environmental factors are held mostly constant and improvement is measured in milliseconds. During his senior year of high school, he was at the peak of his fitness, so it has been challenging to not be able to hit the same splits a year later. &ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t very happy with my swims [at our meets],&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;At the end of the day, I just gotta stick with it, though.&rdquo;</p>

                                <p>Regardless of the times in the pool, Yeh has enjoyed the social aspects of competing on a team with people from such diverse backgrounds. Like Lawson, he is suitemates with teammates, and that has given him a good community of people who are also committed to athletics and academics. He remembers one especially tough dry land workout, with his suitemates stretched out on the common room floor after an exhausting two-mile run. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I would want to continue something if I didn&rsquo;t have friends or mentors or people I enjoyed swimming with,&rdquo; he said.</p>

                                <p>Next year&rsquo;s recruited freshmen have already signed their commitments to the University, and Sarussi has one piece of advice for those prospective student-athletes: Be open to change. In her case, it is advice that she put to use the weekend after our interview. The track team had a meet, but even a few days before competition, she was not totally sure if she would be competing. That is the way it has gone for most of the season, with coaches trying to navigate COVID-19 restrictions and guidelines. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s already a lot of adjustment when you come to college, and with the pandemic, it&rsquo;s tenfold,&rdquo; Sarussi said. &ldquo;Be open to adjustments within training and practices.&rdquo;</p>

                                <p>The things that have stood out to these freshmen have not been the hard workouts or the long practices. Instead, it has been the occasional glimpse of normalcy within such a chaotic year. For Lawson, on the volleyball team, she thinks back to a Forest Park picnic with the rest of her volleyball class. Her teammates were there for her within the stress and challenges of the first few days. Benson, the cross country athlete, remembers an upperclassman taking him aside after an individual track session to impart some advice: Do not be obsessed with hitting a certain mileage. In Yeh&rsquo;s mind, the weekly time trials on Saturday afternoons stood out to him. After hard weeks of training, the swimmers still put in a solid effort in a low-stakes environment against their teammates. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s pride in saying, &lsquo;Oh, I got you on that one,&rsquo;&rdquo; he said. In a normal year, that meal or that time trial would just be one of many others. This year, each was particularly special. </p>
