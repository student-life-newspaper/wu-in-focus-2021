                                    <p class="dear-readers">Dear readers,</p>
                                    <p>WU in Focus was established in the fall of 2018 as a dedicated space to understand how all of the people of Washington University make the community we know. We launched the second installment in the late spring of 2020, as students were faced with another challenge: the COVID-19 global pandemic. It’ll just be through the end of the semester, end of the summer, end of the calendar year, we told ourselves as we faced challenges we could have never anticipated.</p>                            
                                    <p>In the midst of this uncertainty, global anti-racist movements like Black Lives Matter and groups fighting anti-Asian hatred defined campus as the structural racism, discrimination and inequities that plague the University came under increased scrutiny as students demanded justice and change. The work of activists spurred movements calling for the abolition of Greek life and of the Washington University Police Department. Students fought against anti-Asian racism and collectively demanded that the University community reckon with the inequities generations of students, faculty and community members have had to face.</p>
                                    <p>As a student newspaper, we have a unique position on campus. Our reporters and writers often get a bird’s-eye view of the University community. Across our five sections, we have an opportunity to speak with and learn from the different voices that shape the University into what it is. It is spaces like WU in Focus, however, that give us a chance to dive in headfirst. </p>
                                    <p>In this issue, you’ll find reporting on how activist movements like the abolish WUPD took hold on campus, the ways students have experienced the COVID-19 pandemic, how students are fighting against anti-Asian racism and so much more. The reporting in this magazine is a product of the voices of this campus. We hope that this special issue challenges you to think about how the intersecting identities of students, advocacy work on campus and the history of our University shape how your time here is spent. </p>
                                    <p>This issue is shaped by you, as part of our University community. I want to thank you for your readership, engagement and for helping to make this University community what it is: a vibrant, dynamic, diverse and curious place. </p>
                                    <p>All that being said, it is my absolute pleasure to present Student Life’s third installment of WU in Focus.</p>
                                    <p>Take care,</p>

                                        <p class="caption">The Association of Black Collegians leads a sit in at the office of Campus Police, protesting the assault and arrest of Elbert Walton in 1968.</p>
                                    </div>
                                    <p class="dropcap-light-blue">More than 50 years after one of the first protests in response to injustice from Washington University in St. Louis law enforcement, the increased visibility of police brutality has led to a proliferation of groups challenging the role of policing at the University.</p>
                                    <p>In 1968, prior to the formation of WUPD, Elbert Walton, a Black graduate student, was arrested and assaulted by campus police. The event sparked a 30-person sit-in at the office of the campus police followed by an eight-day occupation of Brookings Hall, according to reporting from Student Life.</p>
                                    <p>Led by the Association of Black Collegians (ABC), a Black student activist group, students demanded the suspension of the police officer involved and outlined &ldquo;5 points for developing a position paper on law enforcement reform.&rdquo; These points included better screening and selection of officers, increased officer salaries, improved training, stronger sense of community between law enforcement and students and altered police focus.</p>
                                    <p>During the sit-in, ABC published the Black Position Paper where they saw the mistreatment of Black students by police as a symptom of a lack of University commitment to its Black students and faculty.</p>
                                    <p>&ldquo;The matter of the campus police department&rsquo;s maltreatment of and demeaning attitudes toward Black people does not present the total scope of the problem. It simply reflects and points out the unresponsive, insensitive and negative nature of Washington University vis-a-vis the Black people who come into direct and/or indirect contact with it,&rdquo; the group wrote.</p>
                                    <p>The then Chancellor Thomas H. Eliot responded to the student&rsquo;s demands with &ldquo;reluctant acceptance,&rdquo; according to Robert Johnson, a leader of the ABC.</p>
                                    <p>&ldquo;An eight-member joint committee, chaired by Mr. Andrew Thomas, is making the investigation of selection processes, training, etc. that was recommended by the panel which heard allegations of a pattern of harassment of Black students,&rdquo; Eliot wrote in a March 1969 letter to the University faculty, administration officers and staff.</p>
                                    <p>Over 50 years after the sit-in, the nature of the University&rsquo;s police force has dramatically changed.</p>
                                    <p>WUPD &ldquo;was first established in 1969 as a kind of security department,&rdquo; Executive Vice Chancellor for Civic Affairs and Strategic Planning Hank Webber explained. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s now about 57/58 employees, 37 officers&#8230;In the mid-&rsquo;70s, they became deputized so that they had police powers on campus.&rdquo;</p>
                                    <p>In the 2000s, WUPD transitioned to a community policing model, gaining a &ldquo;major presence in the neighborhood,&rdquo; Webber added.</p>
                                    <p>Still, students continued to object to this expansion of WUPD&rsquo;s presence on campus. On January 23, 2015, in reaction to police brutality across the country, especially the shooting of Michael Brown which occurred just a few miles away from campus, the student group Students in Solidarity (SIS) published a new list of demands, some of which addressed WUPD.</p>
                                    <p>&ldquo;Today, we are sparked by the unconscionable killings of Michael Brown, Eric Garner, John Crawford, Aiyana Jones, Tamir Rice, Yvette Smith, Kajieme Powell, and hundreds more,&rdquo; SIS wrote in their manifesto.</p>
                                    <p>Their demands included but were not limited to mental health support and bias training for WUPD officers, a third-party review of current training procedures, phone and web applications to report WUPD bias and publication of reports of WUPD bias.</p>
                                    <p>According to WUPD Chief Mark Glenn, WUPD officers receive mental health and anti-bias training. He reported that there have been recent audits of these procedures. Additionally, instances of WUPD bias can be reported through the University&rsquo;s bias reporting system.</p>
                                    <p>Although the service does not offer a phone line for reporting, general summaries of bias reports that provide targeted identities and locations reported are available through the University website. The most recent report was posted in 2018.</p>
                                    <p>Professor Gerald Early, a member of the public safety committee focused on examining WUPD&rsquo;s role on campus, attributed the recent rise of student activism directed at University police in part to increased visibility of police brutality.</p>
                                    <p>&ldquo;I think that&rsquo;s made a particular kind of impact to see some of this stuff actually being filmed,&rdquo; Early said.</p>
                                    <p>A student group formed at the beginning of last semester, WashU Students for Abolition, is one of the first to have the primary aim of fully abolishing WUPD. The organization fights to decrease WUPD presence, move WUPD funding to campus resources such as the Sexual Assault and Rape Anonymous Helpline (S.A.R.A.H) and the Rape and Sexual Violence Prevention (R.S.V.P) Center, hire more mental health counselors and, ultimately, abolish WUPD, student organizer junior Jasmine MacFarlane said.</p>
                                    <p>&ldquo;Reform usually comes with more money, more training, more officers, and it makes the system larger rather than addressing the root issues. Abolition addresses the root issues that create crime,&rdquo; MacFarlane stated.</p>
                                    <p>Glenn emphasized that a lack of meaningful change to police departments can drive people towards abolition.</p>
                                    <p>&ldquo;If we're not getting change and we're still seeing that [police brutality], we as a society then are going to continue pushing forward, and if that means you know that we're going to call to abolish police departments, you know, that's where people are going to go if they don't see change,&rdquo; Glenn said.</p>
                                    <p>According to Glenn, WUPD is committed to reform.</p>
                                    <p>&ldquo;We want to make sure that we're providing the best possible service to our community, and, to do that, you really have to listen to the community and be willing to change,&rdquo; Glenn said.</p>
                                    <p>Webber noted WUPD&rsquo;s 2018 accreditation through the Commission of Accreditation for Law Enforcement Agencies (CALEA).</p>
                                    <p>&ldquo;One of the reasons that we went through the international accreditation process, for example, was to make sure that an outside review was making sure that we were meeting the highest law enforcement standards for a university police department,&rdquo; Webber said.</p>
                                    <p>MacFarlane sees campus police presence as directly linked to increased &ldquo;student consciousness and activism.&rdquo;</p>
                                    <p>Campus police &ldquo;sprung up directly in the &lsquo;60s and &lsquo;70s in response to civil rights movements on campus, in response to anti-war protests on campus,&rdquo; MacFarlane said. &ldquo;So, police presence usually is less about students&rsquo; security and more about quelling unrest.&rdquo;</p>
                                    <p>The SIS concluded the foreword of their manifesto with a call to action.</p>
                                    <p>&ldquo;The University must live up to its mission statement &lsquo;to strive to enhance the lives and livelihoods of students, the people of the greater St. Louis community, the country, and the world,&rsquo;&rdquo; they wrote. &ldquo;Seize this crucial moment in history to affirm that Black Lives Matter.&rdquo; </p>

                                <p class="dropcap-light-blue">My first week at Washington University was exciting and terrifying in all the ways first weeks usually are. For me, beyond the customary first-week stilted conversations and first walks to the Delmar Loop, I remember feeling nervous for another reason: Sunday.</p>

                                <p>Before I came to Wash. U., Sundays were church days, and functioned differently than the rest of the days of the week. On Sundays, I set my alarms and woke up early. I sang hymns, read scripture and asked for prayers. Sunday was the day of the week on which I wore the mask, professing what I didn&rsquo;t believe to blend in with the crowd.</p>
                                
                                <p>I knew since I was 12 that I was unconvinced of the existence of a God, but the process of coming to terms with that fact was infinitely less certain. Every woman in my family was deeply religious. God wasn&rsquo;t a question but a foregone conclusion, and it felt scary&mdash;alienating, really&mdash;to challenge it. Moreover, growing up in a majority-white area and school, churches were some of the first and only primarily Black spaces I had ever encountered. Blackness and spirituality went hand in hand, and it was a connection steeped in history I was proud to be a part of. In church, I knew that the hymns I sang used to be slave spirituals&mdash;that the prayers I learned were popularized by Black church leaders. I felt a little closer to my loved ones, my ancestors.</p>
                                
                                <p>However, by my senior year of high school, the cultural aspect of religion no longer felt like enough. I wanted to confront the things I believed and the reasons why I believed them. I hated feeling like I had inherited a worldview rather than chosen one. So, months before I left for Wash. U., I tried to evaluate the contents of my brain. What things do I believe? What things am I unconvinced of? What things do I never want to believe again? When I finally arrived at the term &ldquo;atheist,&rdquo; it felt like a fundamental rejection not only of my belief system but of part of my culture. Church started to feel empty; the hymns and prayers no longer felt like they belonged to me. Religion had been such a formative and intrinsic part of many of my family members&rsquo; lives&mdash;something to cling to through difficult times, a source of spiritual peace and in some cases a reason to stay alive. But suddenly, it was an experience that we could no longer pretend to share. I felt like I was excising myself from both my family and my culture. Frightening as that was, I knew that being hundreds of miles away from home at Wash. U. would be my real chance.</p>
                                
                                <p>My first Sunday at Wash. U., I slept in. I tidied my dorm and tried Village Brunch for the first time. My Sundays belonged to me&mdash;only me. Not only my Sundays, but all of my days. I stopped praying before my meals and stopped asking for forgiveness when I used God&rsquo;s name in vain. And I was terrified.</p>
                                
                                <p>I knew very few Black atheists. I definitely didn&rsquo;t know any other Black female atheists. As far as my family was concerned, I was still a practicing Christian. I couldn&rsquo;t find any secular or atheist organizations on campus&mdash;at least, none that were still active. So I began the process of deconverting myself on my own. And just as much as I knew I didn&rsquo;t necessarily belong in the atheist community, the community knew that I didn&rsquo;t belong, either. The atheist spaces I perused were almost always exclusionary. I rented books from atheist thinkers whom I later realized believed that I had an &ldquo;unconscious wish for brutal male domination&rdquo; and spewed vile, Islamophobic sentiments at every opportunity. I participated in forums that deferred to male pronouns as a rule and witnessed a concerning pipeline from secularism to alt-right beliefs. I went from being welcomed as a Black Christian in a large community to being invisible and often unwelcome as a Black atheist in a tiny community.</p>
                                
                                <p>There is a certain image that comes to mind when one pictures the manifestation of the word &ldquo;atheist.&rdquo; That image is white and male, and not without reason&mdash;data from Pew Research&rsquo;s 2014 Religious Landscape Survey found that 78% of all atheists identified as white, and 68% identified as male. On the other hand, a 2020 Pew survey found that 97% of Black adults believed in a higher power. Only one percent identified with the term &ldquo;atheist.&rdquo; Over one-third of all Black adults in the United States attended services at a church that was majority Black. Black women were more likely than Black men to say that religion was very important in their lives&mdash;64% compared to 51%.</p>
                                
                                <p>The lack of a belief in a higher power tends to be higher among college students and graduates, so the demographic breakdown within colleges could likely look different than the data nationwide. However, the culture around belief in many Black spaces does not encourage the open expression of nonreligious beliefs even when we arrive at college. A few months into my freshman year, a Black female friend of mine, in whom I had confided my religious doubts while we were in high school, reached out to me and admitted that she was also in the process of deconverting herself. I called her and we talked for hours&mdash;about lying to our families about attending church services regularly while away at school; about following religious rituals when at home to avoid an argument; about feeling lonely and unaccepted by atheist spaces that we attempted to join; about the frustration of our families' attempts to proselytize us, or their assumptions that we were immoral. It was unbelievably cathartic to express those emotions to someone who could understand the full depth of the intersection of experiences within Black female atheism&mdash;a minority within the minority.</p>
                                
                                <p>My family and denomination raised me to sincerely believe in divine, eternal retribution. It is not easy to stop believing in that&mdash;it is not easy to assure yourself that you will not be tortured for not being able to believe the things everyone else believes. It is not easy knowing that some of your dearest loved ones truly believe that you deserve that fate. It is not easy to carry these things while being an outsider on multiple fronts. Not easy, but not impossible. I&rsquo;m learning to enjoy brunch on Sunday mornings.</p>

                                <p class="dropcap-light-blue">Katie Lawson, a freshman on the Washington University volleyball team, still has practice in the mornings. Her phone buzzes early, but sometimes it takes multiple times hitting the snooze button to roll out of bed. Lawson has never been a morning person. That is where her suitemate, who is also on the volleyball team, comes in. They will knock on each other&rsquo;s door if they accidentally sleep in. And ultimately, what motivates her during those early morning practices is the thought of her teammates, who are also excited to be there. In that respect, it could be any other year.</p>

                                <p>So many elements of freshmen athletes&rsquo; first year at Washington University have been different because of the pandemic, like the threat of quarantine&mdash;and everyone coped differently. A cross country runner uploaded a five kilometer run onto Strava, a run-sharing platform, from the confines of his quarantine room. Student-athletes searched YouTube for the craziest workouts they could find that were doable within their confines. Freshman golfer Caraline Oakley even putted from her quarantine room in preparation for her tournament win in her debut outing for the University.</p>

                                <p>Across various Bears teams, student-athletes are comparing their hopes during signing to the reality of being on a University team. Lawson committed to Wash. U. volleyball because of the competitive nature of the program. Those expectations for a positive yet challenging environment have mostly been met, despite how things have looked different. &ldquo;I wish we could have more of that game day experience,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;But I still wouldn&rsquo;t trade anything in the world for the experience that I have and the opportunities I&rsquo;ve been able to receive.&rdquo;   For Lawson, like most others, playing at Wash. U. has been a transition from her less driven high school team. There, she found that some people played volleyball purely for the social aspect of the experience. They did not spend much time dedicating themselves to improvement. But at Wash. U., the entire team is much more competitive and hardworking, even in such an irregular season. That, she says, has been fun to be a part of. &ldquo;As someone who enjoys competing and likes to win,&rdquo; Lawson said, &quot;it reassures me that all these people have the same goals and aspirations. They&rsquo;ll have my back.&rdquo;</p>

                                <p>The lack of competition has been hard for everyone. In high school, volleyball athletes play constantly, so Lawson feels out of practice from what she calls game mode. The upside of that is that it has allowed her to spend more time working on technique and overall strength. When they do eventually play next, all NCAA teams will &ldquo;be starting from square one,&rdquo; in terms of competition experience, Lawson said. &ldquo;It will really show who put in the work, who was dedicated and disciplined. It&rsquo;ll be fun to see who progressed over the past year and who let things slide.&rdquo;</p>

                                <p>But not every team has been able to have that same experience of working together with a future goal in mind. One freshman track and field athlete, Ally Sarussi, had high aspirations that have been put on hold with the fluctuating competition season. As with many other athletes, it was the family atmosphere of the track team that first drew her to Wash. U. Although she has bonded with the teammates who are in her specific workout group, Sarussi has been isolated from the group at large. The team has had to split into pods for practice, a system that has prevented her from meeting most of her teammates. &ldquo;It makes it really hard,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s been different and not exactly favorable, but better to get to know some people than none, I guess.&rdquo;</p>

                                <p>Track specifically has had a few time trials, and Sarussi says that they have really helped her grasp the joy of competing again. Instead of stressing over small issues, she has learned to take advantage of the race day environment that she has. And while that is not necessarily glamorous, with fans filling the bleachers, she feels that it has rewarded the training she has put in. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the small wins of being able to compete even against our teammates,&rdquo; Sarussi said. Similarly to Sarussi, Micah Benson, a freshman on the cross country team, has made the most of the training that he has been able to put in. His time on the team has consisted of periods of smaller group practice separated by pauses and COVID-19 outbreaks. Those changes have rewarded him with time for a slower transition into college athletics. As he trains more with head coach Jeff Stiles, the difficulty of the workouts has been ramping up. One piece of advice that Benson&rsquo;s high school coach gave him was not to expect to be automatically better in college. So even though he might not be in the same shape as his senior year of high school, he is not worried.</p>

                                <p>Benson is also growing through Stiles&rsquo; holistic approach to training. A major difference that he has found between running at Wash. U. and his training in high school is how invested the coaching staff is. He said that Stiles cares about everyone on the team, no matter their place on the roster. &ldquo;He told us that he feels bad that he&rsquo;s not connecting enough&mdash;he&rsquo;s doing such a good job with it though,&rdquo; Benson said. &ldquo;So I&rsquo;m excited for when we&rsquo;re back to normal.&rdquo; That progress is not always linear, however, as Kenneth Yeh, a freshmen on the swim team, has realized this semester. As a distance swimmer, he has had to adjust his workouts and mentality to match the restrictions on time in the pool. Many times, the shortened pool slots just do not feel like enough time to get in a proper warm-up, workout and cooldown. &ldquo;That transition has been more difficult for me than others,&rdquo; Yeh said. The team is doing more sprint and power-oriented workouts, which have been hard both mentally and physically for him. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not thinking negatively, but it has made a change on me. And I think I just need more time to adjust to it,&rdquo; he said.</p>

                                <p>The day after the NCAA competitions and the conference championships were canceled for Yeh&rsquo;s first season for Wash. U., he headed to practice assuming that his coaches would make workouts a little easier. He was surprised then when the coaching staff did not let up. So when Yeh had the opportunity to compete during the two meets of the swim team&rsquo;s season, he had to make the most of his limited opportunities. And that, he says, has been tough, particularly with the change in training. It is especially hard with such a time-based sport like swim, where the environmental factors are held mostly constant and improvement is measured in milliseconds. During his senior year of high school, he was at the peak of his fitness, so it has been challenging to not be able to hit the same splits a year later. &ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t very happy with my swims [at our meets],&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;At the end of the day, I just gotta stick with it, though.&rdquo;</p>

                                <p>Regardless of the times in the pool, Yeh has enjoyed the social aspects of competing on a team with people from such diverse backgrounds. Like Lawson, he is suitemates with teammates, and that has given him a good community of people who are also committed to athletics and academics. He remembers one especially tough dry land workout, with his suitemates stretched out on the common room floor after an exhausting two-mile run. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I would want to continue something if I didn&rsquo;t have friends or mentors or people I enjoyed swimming with,&rdquo; he said.</p>

                                <p>Next year&rsquo;s recruited freshmen have already signed their commitments to the University, and Sarussi has one piece of advice for those prospective student-athletes: Be open to change. In her case, it is advice that she put to use the weekend after our interview. The track team had a meet, but even a few days before competition, she was not totally sure if she would be competing. That is the way it has gone for most of the season, with coaches trying to navigate COVID-19 restrictions and guidelines. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s already a lot of adjustment when you come to college, and with the pandemic, it&rsquo;s tenfold,&rdquo; Sarussi said. &ldquo;Be open to adjustments within training and practices.&rdquo;</p>

                                <p>The things that have stood out to these freshmen have not been the hard workouts or the long practices. Instead, it has been the occasional glimpse of normalcy within such a chaotic year. For Lawson, on the volleyball team, she thinks back to a Forest Park picnic with the rest of her volleyball class. Her teammates were there for her within the stress and challenges of the first few days. Benson, the cross country athlete, remembers an upperclassman taking him aside after an individual track session to impart some advice: Do not be obsessed with hitting a certain mileage. In Yeh&rsquo;s mind, the weekly time trials on Saturday afternoons stood out to him. After hard weeks of training, the swimmers still put in a solid effort in a low-stakes environment against their teammates. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s pride in saying, &lsquo;Oh, I got you on that one,&rsquo;&rdquo; he said. In a normal year, that meal or that time trial would just be one of many others. This year, each was particularly special. </p>

                                <p class="note">This article is an opinion piece and thus maintains the position of the writers’ opinions. Additional student experiences are shared in this article.</p>

                                <p class="dropcap-light-green">Freshman Neha George hadn&rsquo;t been sleeping well. She didn&rsquo;t know what had thrown off her sleeping patterns, but she had noticed that she was getting behind in her schoolwork and felt anxious. After putting her mental health aside for a few months, she finally decided that it was time to talk to a therapist.</p>

                                <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t fully process everything that I&rsquo;m feeling or understand everything until I say it out loud and work it out with someone else,&rdquo; George said.</p>

                                <p>College life can take a toll on students&rsquo; mental health. With the combination of newfound independence and demanding classes, students find themselves abruptly making adjustments and facing significant life decisions. On top of these burdens, current Wash. U. students have had to deal with the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has exacerbated mental health problems worldwide. Many, like George, have turned to Wash. U.&rsquo;s mental health resources.</p>

                                <p>When George first called Habif at 11:15 a.m. on Feb. 25, no one answered. That phone call was her second attempt at setting up a consultation; she had tried to schedule a consultation a few days prior through the student portal, which she found confusing.</p>

                                <p>&ldquo;I had a bunch of issues the first couple times I tried to sign up where it wasn&rsquo;t giving me any valid appointments,&rdquo; George said.</p>

                                <p>While Habif called George back later that day, some students have experienced repeated failed attempts to get in contact with mental health resources. Three calls, two emails and a whole semester later, freshman Grace Chen was still not able to access mental health resources at Wash. U.</p>

                                <p>&ldquo;I called three times on different weekdays at different times. The first time was in the afternoon and outside of their operating hours, but the next two, I called during their [business] hours. I got an answering machine all three times, which only gave instructions for what to do if I had an emergency,&rdquo; Chen said.</p>

                                <p>Although Chen never was able to access the mental health resources she needed, some students have been able to make it through the multi-step process to set up an appointment. In many instances, however, complications and setbacks in the process remain due to the confusing nature of the websites and phone lines.</p>

                                <p>&ldquo;My experience made me think Habif&rsquo;s mental health services are not effectively organized or accessible enough,&rdquo; Chen said. The services are not accessible enough&ndash;&ndash;it is not impossible to access mental health resources, but the process is often not an easy one.</p>

                                <p class="bold">Who do you call?</p>

                                <p>While researching mental health resources at Wash. U., we found it especially difficult to determine how to reach out for specific mental health needs, as different needs require different resources. The centralized location for information is Habif&rsquo;s main mental health website. While links to other pages are organized on this website, some of the pages lead to confusing information.</p>

                                <p>The menu option &ldquo;Assisting a Student in Distress&rdquo; leads to a &ldquo;Suicide Prevention Training&rdquo; program, which lists some &ldquo;warning signs&rdquo; of mental health issues, such as being &ldquo;too busy studying or surfing the web.&rdquo; This phrase demonstrates that mental health services may be out of touch with students today. An activity such as busily &ldquo;surfing the web&rdquo; is not necessarily a telling warning sign of mental health issues&ndash;&ndash;we live in an era where it is common for people to spend most of their time online, especially in our current hybrid learning environment. This fundamental misunderstanding could be harmful when it comes to the ability of Wash. U. mental health services to connect with and understand the day-to-day lives of the average student.</p>

                                <p>While the mental health page mostly provides information about how a peer can step in to help students in distress, it does also instruct students to call campus police in immediate safety situations, to call the main Habif line for &ldquo;non-life threatening&rdquo; emergencies within business hours and to call a different number (314-935-6666) and press one for after-hours service.</p>

                                <p>The National Mental Health Service phone numbers are located in the menu option &ldquo;n In Case of Mental Health Emergency and Crisis Response,&rdquo; which can be helpful resources for students. Students also have the option of calling the after-hours number, which directs students to press one if Wash. U. Express Care&ndash;&ndash;a student resource for &ldquo;same-day virtual and in-person [medical] care&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash; is closed. Wash. U. Express Care is helpful for instances that threaten safety within hours of operation, but they don&rsquo;t have mental health assistance outside of psychiatry appointments, and in emergency situations, this is not the best option.</p>

                                <p>The problem with the page for students in distress is that it lists WUPD as the only immediate intervention option. There are many instances in which a student may need immediate mental health intervention that policing cannot help with&ndash;&ndash;this is especially true in cases where bodily safety isn&rsquo;t an immediate concern. Additionally, students who have not had good experiences with on-campus or off-campus police may be hesitant to reach out if that is their only option, creating a further barrier in receiving help.</p>

                                <p>With unreliable means of outreach, it can be discouraging for students to continue their search for mental health resources. Taking care of one&rsquo;s mental health becomes increasingly important in college, so Habif resources should be easily accessible to all students.</p>

                                <p class="bold">The Infrastructure</p>

                                <p>For Neha George, the area that mental health services should focus on is &ldquo;transparency.&rdquo; This could be done by being clear and transparent about how many free appointments students get each semester. According to George, information about how many free appointments she would receive wasn&rsquo;t provided to her in her initial consultation phone call, and she had to explicitly ask about pricing in that phone call in order to learn that information. George&rsquo;s call for transparency also applies to the phone lines, business hours and student portal.</p>

                                <p>&ldquo;When you&rsquo;re filling out that initial form, it would be nice to have a little message that says, &lsquo;If you&rsquo;re having difficulty, this is our number, here are our hours, et cetera,&rsquo;&rdquo; George said.</p>

                                <p>George only had to wait one day for her consultation, which was &ldquo;pretty standard.&rdquo; After the consultation, she scheduled her appointment with a therapist for about two weeks out. As none of her needs were immediate or life-threatening, George didn&rsquo;t mind the two-week wait.</p>

                                <p>For sophomore Sam Cohen, however, having to wait multiple weeks for an appointment was not an option. Last fall, with the combination of school, the pandemic and other factors, Cohen&rsquo;s anxiety was returning at concerning rates. She was starting to have panic attacks again, something she hadn&rsquo;t experienced in a long time. As someone who has had a therapist since the fourth grade, Cohen recognized her symptoms quickly and knew she needed to contact Habif.</p>

                                <p>The first appointment she scheduled got canceled last minute, as Habif had accidentally scheduled her appointment with a therapist that only talked to graduate students. But now, Cohen needed immediate assistance&ndash;&ndash;she was having a panic attack. She called the after-hours Habif line for non-life threatening emergencies, which connected her to an on-call therapist.</p>

                                <p>Although she was able to meet with a therapist, for Cohen, the appointment felt like an &ldquo;interrogation&rdquo; rather than a helpful conversation. At the end of the appointment, Cohen learned that the soonest she could see the therapist again was in three weeks.</p>

                                <p>&ldquo;At that moment in time, I knew I was going to have to start going back to therapy every week,&rdquo; Cohen said. She decided to seek off-campus resources, something that she acknowledged she is privileged to have access to.</p>

                                <p>This wasn&rsquo;t Cohen&rsquo;s only interaction with mental health resources on campus. In January 2020, she contacted Habif, seeking a refill for her anxiety-related medications. After sending in her medical records and receiving no response, she called Habif again about a week later, when she learned that the person who was in charge of reading medical records was out sick.</p>

                                <p>&ldquo;I was like, &lsquo;You only have one singular person reading the medical records and organizing them?&rsquo;&rdquo; Cohen said. &ldquo;It was very strange to me that one person was sick, so that halted their operation.&rdquo;</p>

                                <p>From her experiences, Cohen attributes the setbacks and frustrations she faced to an overwhelmed staff.</p>

                                <p>&ldquo;They need more than they have,&rdquo; Cohen said.</p>

                                <p>Wash. U. currently has 11 therapists and five psychiatrists directly affiliated with the University. In addition, the University has partnered with Provident Behavioral Health as an extra mental health resource specifically for after-hours support. This locally operated business has an independent crisis response number, many different types of counseling and therapy and support groups. This is a step in the right direction, and it is a resource option that Habif and Wash. U. should more effectively communicate to students. With further implementation and accessibility, this resource could greatly benefit the student population.</p>

                                <p>The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted mental health resources across the globe. While Wash. U. has been similarly affected, the University has also made some efforts to accommodate the increased mental health needs on campus. Two additional therapists not directly affiliated with Wash. U. have been assisting with mental health services this semester.</p>

                                <p>However, despite the extra help from both Provident and the two additional therapists, mental health resources are still overwhelmed&ndash;&ndash;students like Cohen have had to wait for two to three weeks to set up appointments. As Cohen pointed out, an overwhelmed staff isn&rsquo;t something new to Habif.</p>

                                <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a little sad that they [Habif mental health staff] couldn&rsquo;t even keep up with people back in January before the pandemic happened,&rdquo; Cohen said.</p>

                                <p class="bold">Looking on to the future</p>

                                <p>The lack of available mental health professionals had led to a lack of support for students, as is also seen in the campus&rsquo;s immediate mental health intervention response. As of now, after hours support is limited and somewhat ambiguous. Calls to change the policing system at Wash. U. have involved the context of mental health emergency response, in which WUPD is the primary responder to any emergency, including mental health emergencies.</p>

                                <p>The University&rsquo;s public safety report, released in February 2021, has acknowledged some of students&rsquo; concerns about WUPD being the only immediate intervention resource besides the Emergency Support Team (EST). The report recommended &ldquo;new methods for triaging responding to non-traditional public safety concerns,&rdquo; such as to &ldquo;send resources that are appropriate to the incident, not just WUPD because they answer 24/7.&rdquo;</p>

                                <p>EST is composed of Wash. U. students who are trained through their undergraduate experience to respond to on-campus emergencies, but they are still reached only through the WUPD phone number. While this leads to some diversity in the emergency response team, it still doesn&rsquo;t give students the option to choose between who actually responds. The public safety report also acknowledged that this &ldquo;creates barriers&rdquo; for students whose interactions with police have not been positive.</p>

                                <p>If the public safety committee follows through with their suggestions, Wash. U. could be on track to successfully addressing these concerns, but acknowledgement is not action&ndash;&ndash;the public safety committee must follow through by making concrete changes to how WUPD and EST operate. For example, allowing students to call EST without having to go through WUPD could create an opportunity for students needing immediate mental health intervention to confidently seek help.  Despite steps in the right direction, the committee also recommended increasing funding to WUPD in order to add the mental health resources that they recommend. By adding funds to WUPD to complete this task, that response team would still be affiliated with WUPD, which goes against the goal of creating an environment where students feel safe and comfortable contacting emergency mental health services. This funding should instead be used to create a response team that is completely separate from WUPD&ndash;&ndash;and could be called upon instead of WUPD&ndash;&ndash;with professionals who are trained in mental health services and available 24/7. In order to ensure a distinction from WUPD, the response team could also become a part of Habif instead of being a completely independent service.  Despite the problems with emergency response as well as with accessing resources in the first place, many students have been able to go through the process and access the resources they need. Wash. U. student Sage Vasconcellos-Merryman&rsquo;s first semester of college didn&rsquo;t start out ideally, so she decided to get in touch with Habif to discuss her options.</p>

                                <p>&ldquo;Between not being on campus for physical classes, the time difference and my family environment, [it] was not good for me because I've had ongoing struggles with depression,&rdquo; Vasconcellos-Merryman said.</p>

                                <p>Vasconcellos-Merryman decided to look into campus resources, and she determined that medical leave for the rest of this school year was the best option for her.</p>

                                <p>&ldquo;I ended up almost failing my classes because I couldn&rsquo;t keep up and I was feeling very, very depressed,&rdquo; Vasconcellos-Merryman said. &ldquo;Wash. U. resources were very helpful because they did reach out and solve the issue with me, and I really appreciate the level of understanding.&rdquo;</p>

                                <p>While the bounds of medical leave are not just within Habif, she is still very pleased with the interactions she did have with the mental health services.</p>

                                <p>&ldquo;I was able to talk to a couple counselors, and they were helpful in making my plan with me for the future and planning on a successful return to school in the fall,&rdquo; Vasconcellos-Merryman said.</p>

                                <p>Each student will inevitably have a different experience with mental health resources than fellow classmates. Mental health circumstances, access to the services, level of help received and other factors are highly variable. But as long as there are students who are not getting all of the help they require, there remains room for improvement.</p>

                                <p>The efforts that Wash. U. has made to improve mental health resources on campus have not gone unnoticed. In comparison to other universities, Wash. U.&rsquo;s mental health services are impressive. When it comes to psychiatry, Wash. U. is in the 63% of universities that provide that service. For therapy and mental health counseling, the average university only has one mental health counselor for every 1,737 students. According to fall 2019 numbers, Wash. U. has an undergraduate population of about 7,850 students, and with 11 therapists directly affiliated with Wash. U., there is about one therapist for every 700 students. Two additional therapists not affiliated with the University have been helping this semester, making the ratio about one therapist for every 600 students. These numbers are impressive: Wash. U. has been able to maintain a significantly higher student-to-therapist ratio than the &ldquo;average&rdquo; university.</p>

                                <p>However, having resources that are &ldquo;above average&rdquo; does not mean that the resources are necessarily enough. Available appointments are often weeks away, and students struggle to schedule appointments in the first place due to confusion involving phone calls, websites and other steps in the process. While some may be able to access appointments relatively quickly, wait times are variable and dependent on student demand for resources.</p>

                                <p>Long wait times may be outside of therapists&rsquo; control. COVID-19 has increased the demand for mental health resources, and there are only so many appointments that therapists can take. It is also the University&rsquo;s responsibility to prioritize the mental health of its students. A commitment to mental health can be demonstrated by providing more funding to mental health services and hiring more mental health experts, ensuring that there are enough staff members to meet students&rsquo; needs.</p>

                                <p>Some students&rsquo; needs require expertise outside of Habif&rsquo;s reach. In those cases, Wash. U. therapists are prepared to refer students to off-campus resources. However, not all Wash. U. students have the means to access resources off-campus that may require high payments and constant transportation. Not everything can be covered in-depth by Wash. U.&rsquo;s services, but by expanding resources to as many areas as possible, Wash. U. can ensure that students who rely on Habif&rsquo;s free and reduced-price appointments can get the help they need. Therapists should be aware of the range of students&rsquo; needs and should be able to recognize when someone might need a more immediate appointment. Something like a panic attack, as in Cohen&rsquo;s story, should be given proper attention.</p>

                                <p>Even with a collective total of 13 therapists for the semester, mental health services seem to be spread too thin. There are long wait times for scheduling appointments, too few counselors and not enough mental health professionals available for immediate intervention. The attention to detail in online resources is not apparent, and if it was, every student would at least be aware of how to find help.</p>

                                <p>Problems with mental health resources are not due to a lack of care or thought, but there is an apparent disconnect between the availability of resources and the resources advertised. Resources become pointless if not adequately made available and advertised, especially in the field of mental health. Overall, students could benefit from more availability of therapists, distinguishing between WUPD and actual crisis intervention resources, a centralized website that is easy to navigate and a mental health program that is easily and consistently accessible. Students should feel confident and comfortable reaching out for help, and in the current state, that is not always the case.</p>

                                <p>Wash. U. already has a solid foundation when it comes to mental health resources. Looking forward, there is so much potential for improvements, and these changes can be made to the already existing system. Wash. U. has demonstrated that it is open to making improvements, and students&rsquo; concerns have been acknowledged. But listening to the demands of students only goes so far&ndash;&ndash;what must come next is action.</p>                            </div>
